# lighthouse-js-batch
A Node JS package that runs multiple Lighthouse audit reports programmatically for many webpages or web apps,  with global or individual configurations per App. It allows you to manipulate the resulting Lighthouse JS object and decide whether to output all the reports or to use the JS object for other purposes.
